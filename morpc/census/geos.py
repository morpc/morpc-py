# TODO (jinskeep_morpc): Develop function for fetching census geographies leveraging scopes
# Issue URL: https://github.com/morpc/morpc-py/issues/102
#   The current geos-lookup workflow is limited by size and scope. This function will be used
#   to fetch geographies at any scale and scope without the need to store it locally. It is 
#   limited to census geographies. 
#   [ ]: Consider storing the data as a remote frictionless resource similar to the acs data class.
#   [ ]: Define scale and scopes that are used. Possibly lists for benchmarking (i.e. Most populous cities)
